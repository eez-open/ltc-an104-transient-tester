LTC [AN104](http://www.linear.com/docs/29876) Closed loop load transient tester Eagle, Gebgers and BOM. It could be used for testing various LDOs, power supplies, etc.
Two PCB variants are available: 

* with power supply (ac-powered) that can be housed e.g. into Hammond diecast aluminium enclosure HM-1590U 
* without power supply (dc-powered) using two external 15 VDC sources connected with 2.1/5.5 mm DC plugs.

**Please note that max. allowed D.U.T voltage is determined with switching transistor SOA.**
